<div id="wide">
<h1 class="first">Mypy Development Roadmap</h1>

<p>This is the outline of the current mypy development roadmap. As everything
else, this is subject to change at any time.


<h2>Milestone 1: Type checker and mypy-to-Python translator [DONE]</h2>

<p>Implement type checker for a significant subset of mypy. Support running
mypy programs via translation to Python + using CPython (perhaps also PyPy,
if Python 2/3 compatibility can be addressed).

<p>The implementation will be good for early adopters and for the evaluation of
the programming model.

<p>Schedule: Nov 2012 [DONE]

<h2>Milestone 2: Switch to Python-compatible syntax [DONE]</h2>

<p>Based on feedback, switch to a new, Python-compatible
syntax. Also change the development focus to optional type checking on top of
a standard Python implementation instead of on building a new compiler and
VM.

<p>Schedule: Jul 2013 [DONE]

<h2>Milestone 3: More Python and type system features [DONE]</h2>

<p>The focus is on supporting a wider set of Python features and
libraries, and on implementing new type system features.

<p>The goal is to support (almost) all of Python 3 syntax and
a large set of libraries. Also, mypy now mostly conforms to
PEP 484.

<p>Schedule: 2015 [DONE]

<h2>Milestone 4: Python 2.x support [DONE]</h2>

<p>Add support for Python 2.7 and potentially earlier Python versions. These
are still very widely used and will likely remain so for at least several
years.

<p>Schedule: 2015 [DONE]

<h2>Milestone 5: Faster, incremental type checking</h2>

<p>Support more efficient, incremental type checking. After a code edit, mypy
should only check modules affected by that change instead of the whole program.
This will be useful especially for large projects.

<p>Schedule: 2016

<h2>Milestone 6: Beta release</h2>

<p>After this release, work harder to avoid changes that break backward
compatibility in significant ways. Most critical open issues resolved.

<p>Schedule: 2016?

<h2>Future tasks</h2>

<p>These tasks have not been scheduled yet (in no particular order):

<ul>
  <li>1.0 release
  <li>tool support for migration from dynamic to static typing
  <li>even faster type checking
</ul>

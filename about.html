<h1 class="first">About mypy</h1>

Jukka Lehtosalo began work on mypy in 2012. The project borrows heavily from
Jukka's earlier work on
<a href="http://www.alorelang.org/">Alore</a>, a Python-inspired language
with an optional static type system.

<p>In addition to Python and Alore, the design of mypy has been
influenced by Java, C#, Typed
Racket, Boo, Dart and the work of Jeremy G. Siek and Walid Taha on gradual
typing.

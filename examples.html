<h1 class="first">Mypy Examples</h1>

<p>Here are some mypy example programs. Each example has dynamically typed
Python/mypy code and equivalent statically typed mypy code side by
side. Every program is still valid Python 3.x.
All differences between the variants are
<span class="hili">highlighted</span>.

<h2>Word frequencies with a dictionary</h2>

$example(wordfreq)$

<p>In this example we add an explicit type declaration for the variable d, as
it is not obvious from the local context.

<h2>Simple class</h2>

$example(bank)$

<p>In this example we chose to use integers to represent balance.
This would be fine in a game, for example, but in other applications a
different type would make more sense.

<p>This example was adapted from the
<a href="http://wiki.python.org/moin/SimplePrograms">Python wiki</a> (with
the standard Python license).

<h2>Prime number sieve with generators</h2>

$example(sieve2)$

<p>Like the bank account example, this was adapted from the Python wiki.

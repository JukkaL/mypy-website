         We've been converting mypy documentation to reStructuredText/Sphinx and
         improving it in the process
         (thanks to Ryan Gonzalez for the bulk of the work!). The new docs are
         now public and hosted on <a href="http://mypy.readthedocs.org/en/latest/">readthedocs.org</a>.
         The source code is available <a href="https://github.com/JukkaL/mypy/tree/master/docs/source">on GitHub</a>.

 - title: Mypy only type checks, it does not run programs
   date: 31 Aug 2014
   text: |
         Mypy no longer runs your programs, it just type checks
         them. Use a Python interpreter to run programs.

   date: 24 Jul 2014
   text: |
         Mypy development is seeing progress, after a pause.
         Stay tuned for exciting news! And we're still looking for new contributors.
         Also updated the web site to reflect the current development focus: static type
         checking.

 - title: Mypy switches to Python-compatible syntax
   date: 2 Jul 2013
   text: |
         Mypy now has a Python-compatible syntax! The
         implementation is already self-hosting. Have a look at the
         rewritten <a href="tutorial.html">Mypy Tutorial</a> (formerly Mypy
         Overview), <a href="https://github.com/JukkaL/mypy/blob/master/README.md">README</a>
         and the <a href="https://github.com/JukkaL/mypy">code</a>. Also
         updated the <a href="roadmap.html">roadmap</a>. See the <a href="http://mypy-lang.blogspot.co.uk/2013/07/mypy-switches-to-python-compatible.html">related blog post</a>.

 - title: "PyCon Update: Python-compatible syntax for mypy?"
   date: 15 Apr 2013
   text: |
         I wrote a <a href="http://mypy-lang.blogspot.co.uk/2013/04/pycon-update-python-compatible-syntax.html">blog post</a> about
         my PyCon visit and a new, Python-compatible syntax idea.
         The short summary is that mypy may get a 100% Python-compatible syntax
         in the future! Also Python 2.x support, structural subtyping and real
         multiple inheritance are being planned.

   date: 7 Dec 2012
   text: |
         Mypy source code is
         <a href="https://github.com/JukkaL/mypy">now available</a> on GitHub.
         Fork it and give it a try!
         The current prototype supports a useful but somewhat limited subset of
         Python
         features (library support is still limited) and
         lets you type check programs and run them by translating to Python.
         As such there is no performance boost yet.

 - title: Mypy is self-hosting + language changes
   date: 2 Dec 2012
   text: |
         The mypy implementation has been self-hosting for about two weeks now (on
         top of CPython)! We are happily eating our own dog food.
         The source release is Real Soon Now. The release is a bit late as we
         decided to make some changes and add new features just before the release.

         The short summary is that mypy may get a 100% Python-compatible syntax
         in the future! Also Python 2.x support, structural subtyping and real
         multiple inheritance are being planned.

         Mypy source code is

         Fork it and give it a try!
         The current prototype supports a useful but somewhat limited subset of
         Python
         features (library support is still limited) and
         lets you type check programs and run them by translating to Python.
         As such there is no performance boost yet.

 - title: Mypy is self-hosting + language changes
   date: 2 Dec 2012

         The mypy implementation has been self-hosting for about two weeks now (on
         top of CPython)! We are happily eating our own dog food.
         The source release is Real Soon Now. The release is a bit late as we
         decided to make some changes and add new features just before the release.
